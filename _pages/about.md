I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20344/computer_and_information_sciences/) at [Fordham University](https://www.fordham.edu/), and am also affiliated with the Fordham Center for Cybersecurity. I am a Fordham-NYU and Fordham-IBM fellow. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from New York University (NYU), Tandon School of Engineering in 2020.
